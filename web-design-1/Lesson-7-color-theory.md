##### Color Models

     1. CMYK - stand for Cyan Magenta yellow and black & to create colors this model uses what's called subtractive mixing. I won't go into details because this model is used for printing so it's not that inportant for this course.
     2. RGB - stand for Red Green and Blue & its uses additive mixing of light to create different colors. when overlapping red green and blue at full brightness we get white and this is how screens work.
     3. HSB - stand for Hue Saturation and Brightness. This uses a mix of these three different attributes to create different colors.
     4. HEX(Hexadecimal) --> This is friendlier way of displaying RGB colors because the first two letter/numbers refer to red, the next letter/numbers refer to green and the last two refer to blue.
